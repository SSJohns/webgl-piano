Our project involves creating an interactive learning tool that allows a user to associate 
music notation with its corresponding sound, as well as its location on a keyboard. 
The project includes the creation of a 3D piano keyboard that can be played using computer keyboard keys. 
Another interactive element is the buttons at the top of the screen outlining a C4 major scale, 
which can be pressed to hear the sound of the corresponding pitches. 

#**TO RUN:**

­ Open ‘pianoOne.html’. You can mouse-click each of the 7 buttons up top corresponding to notes of a scale 
to hear the individual sound/pitches, so a user can learn how a pitch sounds and looks.

­ To animate the piano keys independently of the top buttons, press the keyboard keys

The black notes in the images correspond to the # keys, such as C#3, etc and can be played/pressed

To adjust the camera view, use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) and also use mouse­drag to move it as well.
